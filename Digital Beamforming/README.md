# About
The MATLAB file 'Digital_Beamforming.m' contains the code for digital beamforming. The received signal is matched with all the possible azimuth angles. The angle at which the Array Factor value is maximum is the azimuth angle of the target (30 degrees in this simulation).


## Digital Beamforming
The received signal is first simulated with an azimuth angle of 30 degrees with 50 elements in the phased array. Below is the plot after applying digital beamforming.
